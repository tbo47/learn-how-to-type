# LearnHowToType

[learn-how-to-type.com](https://www.learn-how-to-type.com) is an open-source webapp to learn how to type.

It's developped using [angular](https://angular.dev/) and supports US and french keyboards.

The goal is for my 12 years old daughter to learn how to use a keyboard. Any suggestions are welcome!
